 #Wet Worlds
 pd_continental:0 "Continetal World"
 pd_continental_desc:0 "Great landmasses are separated by oceans, with large climate variations depending on latitude and precipitation."
 pd_retinal: "Retinal World"
 pd_retinal_desc: "Plant life is retinaldehyde-based instead of chlorophyll-based giving the planet a distinctive purple hue."
 pd_lake:0 "Lake World"
 pd_lake_desc:0 "The landmass is a single area covered in millions of lakes of all sizes while the climate ranges from subtropical to subartic."
 pd_forest:0 "Forest World"
 pd_forest_desc:0 "Active and stable hydrosphere. Great land masses are almost completely covered in dense forests"
 pd_tepid:0 "Tepid World"
 pd_tepid_desc:0 "Having almost no axis tilt, this world's ideal growing conditions has allowed for the evolution of many types of photosynthetic processes."
 pd_mushroom:0 "Mushroom World"
 pd_mushroom_desc:0 "Fungal life rule the ecosystem of this planet. Vast areas of the planet are covered in mushroom forests and fields."
 pd_temperate:0 "Temperate World"
 pd_temperate_desc:0 "A mild climate and rich biodiveristy makes this world an ideal plance."
 pd_megaflora:0 "Megaflora World"
 pd_megaflora_desc:0 "The dense megaflora world has an abundance of gigantic flora whose giant roots often unearth valuable deposits, and also produce energy-rich sap to utilize. Building around the megaflora means construction costs are higher than normal."
 pd_petrified:0 "Petrified Woods World"
 pd_petrified_desc:0 "The petrified woods can be used for building materials, but take considerable effort to remove for construction."
 pd_ocean:0 "Ocean World"
 pd_ocean_desc:0 "Oceans cover more than §Y90%§! of the surface, with scattered islands making up the remaining percentage."
 pd_cascadian:0 "Cascadian World"
 pd_cascadian_desc:0 "Sub-temperate mountainous of coastal forests and towering mountain ranges. An active, stormy, hydrosphere with strong differences between snowy winters and short warmer summers."
 pd_swamp:0 "Swamp World"
 pd_swamp_desc:0 "Most of the planet is covered with dense forested wetlands. Hydrosphere is strong and stable mainly in shallow seas, swamps and bogs and supports a great abundance of plant and animal life."
 pd_crag:0 "Crag World"
 pd_crag_desc:0 "Oceans and polar ice caps cover most of the surface, with rugged scattered seismically active  islands dotting its surface."
 pd_fog:0 "Fog World"
 pd_fog_desc:0 "Oceans cover much of the surface and extreme humity causes near constant fog moving over the moist forests and grasslands."
 pd_kelp:0 "Kelp World"
 pd_kelp_desc:0 "Oceans cover much of the surface. The rich shallow waters support planet-wide kelp forests and bio-diversity."
 pd_reef:0 "Reef World"
 pd_reef_desc:0 "Shallow oceans cover more than 90% of the surface and the under the surface significant reef systems can be seen from orbit. The only areas above water are where the reef system has grown high enough to create scattered island chains of coral."
 pd_archipelago:0 "Archipelago World"
 pd_archipelago_desc:0 "One planet-wide ocean with scattered island archipelagos covers the surface. The rich volcanic activity causes islands to appear and disappear at a comparatively high rate, creating an always changing landscape."

 pd_tropical:0 "Tropical World"
 pd_tropical_desc:0 "Seasons with significant precipitation are interchanged with drier periods. Most landmasses are covered in dense vegetation."
 pd_atoll:0 "Atoll World"
 pd_atoll_desc:0 "Shallow lagoons, coral reefs and tropical islands make up the majority of this planet, with warm temperatures supporting a very large biosphere."
 pd_tepui:0 "Tepui World"
 pd_tepui_desc:0 "With a significant hydrosphere and covered in dense vegetation, there is a noticeable difference between the cooler rainy plateaus of the tepuis and the warmer humid ground jungle below."
 pd_mangrove:0 "Mangrove World"
 pd_mangrove_desc:0 "Most of the planet is covered in shallow seas with very little land above sea level. Jungles extended for hundreds of miles beyond the shores of the few existing islands."
 pd_cenote:0 "Cenote World"
 pd_cenote_desc:0 "Large sinkholes and underwater river systems snake below the surface of this world. Most landmasses are covered in dense vegetation."
 pd_fungal:0 "Fungal Jungal World"
 pd_fungal_desc:0 "Seasons with significant precipitation, great dense fungal jungles cover the majority of the land masses."
 pd_geothermal:0 "Geothermal"
 pd_geothermal_desc:0 "Tropical rifts that break up the expanses of ice, heated by natural geothermal vents with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The hydrosphere is in melt water and steam rising from vents"
 pd_biolumen:0 "Bioluminescent World"
 pd_biolumen_desc:0 "Particles in the atmosphere cause almost constant cloud cover on this planet but despite this life thrives on the surface. Almost all of the flora and fauna exhibit Bioluminescent traits."
